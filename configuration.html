<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>
Equalizer uses a configuration server to optimally allocate the
available resources on the visualization system to the running applications. The
server is configured using a hierarchically structured configuration file to
describe the available resources and a number of configurations combining the
resources for rendering. Equalizer applications can also run without a server,
in which case they will automatically configure themselves for the local
workstation.
</p>
Possible environments for Equalizer applications are:
<ul>
  <li><b>Multi-pipe Visualization Systems</b> with large-screen
      displays and immersive environments are used by workgroups and individual
      users. The Equalizer server provides the available configurations and
      configures the applications for the visualization cluster or multi-pipe
      machine. The same application can run on all configurations without
      recompilation or reconfiguration.
  </li>
  <li><b>Visualization Data Centers</b> provide visualization services to
      remote users. A central visualization cluster with attached storage
      uses the rendering resources for visualizing huge data sets by
      combining multiple graphics cards for a single client. The Equalizer
      server automatically assigns and balances the available rendering
      resources depending on the workload and needs of the connected users. 
  </li>
  <li><b>Workstations</b> can run Equalizer applications in a server-less mode,
      which facilitates the deployment of Equalizer applications. The same
      application can still run on a server-based system without recompilation.
  </li>
</ul>
