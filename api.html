<h2>Programming Interface</h2>
<p>
Equalizer uses a callback-driven interface. Applications provide their
rendering callbacks, which are called by the Equalizer framework according to
the current configuration and system load. Process and thread creation, task
synchronization and network connections are externalized from the application
and handled transparently by the Equalizer framework.
