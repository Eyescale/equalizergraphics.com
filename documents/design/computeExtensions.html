Status: Request for discussion<BR>
Dependencies: CUDA (libcuda, libcudart)[, OpenCL]<BR>
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p
This extension proposes some modifications to Equalizer which enable the
integration of GPU computing tasks into the programming and execution model
of Equalizer.
</p>
<i>
One step further would be the integration of generic compute tasks, not
limited to GPU computing ("throughput computing"). For example to support
software based rendering on both CPUs and GPUs or compute intensive HPC
tasks in a supercomputing centre.
</i>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Optional usage of CUDA [OpenCL] in Equalizer</li>
<li>Scalability of compute tasks on multi-GPU and cluster systems</li>
<li>Efficient shared GPU memory management</li>
<li>Optimised node-to-node communication</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Design Aspects</h3>
<p>
Equalizer uses <b>Compounds</b> to describe the execution of the rendering
operations. The rendering is performed by <b>Channels</b> which are
referenced by the compounds -- a channel belongs to a <b>Window</b> which
again manages the GL context.
Windows in turn are managed by a <b>Pipe</b> object which provides the
threading logic. Usually, only one window is used per pipe. Internally, each
Window uses an <b>SystemWindow</b> object which abstracts window-system specific
functionality; i.e., using WGL, glX, or AGL. Similarly, an <b>SystemPipe</b>
object is used by each pipe to handle the backend specific device
implementation.
</p>
<p>
<center>
<img src="images/computeClasses.png"><BR><BR>
Figure 1: Overview class diagram (aside from AGL we currently also support
glX and WGL)
</center>
</p>
<p>
When using CUDA one host thread can execute device code on exactly one GPU
device; i.e., a host thread may have only one CUDA device context current
at a time. To support multiple devices multiple host threads are thus
required. This is a perfect match to the pipe abstraction of Equalizer.
On the other hand, since GPU computing does not perform any rendering and
as such does not rely on a drawable, the window abstraction does not fit
(software based rendering is the exception here, since this requires some
soft of framebuffer abstraction).
Instead we use the pipe itself to execute the COMPUTE tasks defined in the
compound description. This fits naturally to the design approach of both
CUDA and OpenCL, and moreover we can avoid introducing another object
hierarchy in parallel to the current pipe - window - channel model.
As a consequence, we can simply use specific attributes on the pipe to set
up the <b>ComputeContext</b> that provides the interface to either CUDA or
OpenCL; see Figure 1.
</p>
<p>
<i>
In this context it would make sense to change the notion of a pipe into a
more generic device abstraction which can represent a GPU, a CPU, or any
other accelerator.
Furthermore, a natural extension would then be to allow an arbitrary
number of threads per device - imagine a multi-core CPU w/ hyperthreading,
for example.
</i>
</p>

<h2>Internal Changes</h2>

<p>
In the first phase we target C for CUDA, later we will add support for
OpenCL. The proposed changes are related to
<ul>
  <li>the proper initialisation of each participating pipe for GPU
      computing purposes, </li>
  <li>the synchronisation of shared (GPU) memory, </li>
  <li>the execution of CUDA kernels.</li>
</ul>
Moreover, the file format is extended to support COMPUTE tasks. There exist
two different use-cases:
<ul>
  <li> Compute tasks are executed on a pipe which also performs OpenGL draw
       operations; i.e. interoperability with OpenGL is enabled.</li>
  <li> Compute tasks are executed on a compute-only device, such as a Tesla
       GPU or a designated GPU.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Initialisation</h3>
<p>
CUDA initialisation is handled by a <b>cudaComputeContext</b> object. In the
future, other contexts might be used, such as <b>clComputeContext</b> for
OpenCL.
The context uses the specified <b>cuda_device</b> to select the appropriate
compute device, or 0 if none is specified explicitely. Internally, the CUDA
device is then selected by calling cudaSetDevice().
If OpenGL interoperability is required the specified CUDA device has to be
set up accordingly. This mode can be selected using the attribute
<b>cuda_gl_interop</b> which results in a call to cudaGLSetGLDevice() using
the appropriate device identifier. Thus, the compute context is set up
after the window (OpenGL context) initialisation.
</p>
<p>
To select the behaviour of synchronous CUDA function calls, either choose
<b>yield</b>, <b>block</b> or <b>spin</b> for the attribute
<b>cuda_sync_mode</b>.
Internally this results in a call to cudaSetDeviceFlags() prior to any other
runtime calls.
</p>

<h3>Execution Model</h3>

<p>
The execution model is based on a special-purpose COMPUTE task, analogous to
the common rendering tasks. To integrate the compute tasks into the
Equalizer execution model, pipes are referenced from the compound structure
just as channels are used for rendering.
</p>
<p><i>
In the common case the COMPUTE tasks are part of the Equalizer rendering
loop. To decouple the task execution from the rendering we might introduce
special-purpose task queues on each compute device (pipe) to schedule
asynchronous tasks (following the OpenCL design approach). In this model,
synchronisation between tasks can be achieved using fence events, for
example.
</i></p>

<p>
Equalizer provides the information required to launch a CUDA kernel as it is
done with other, rendering specific parameters, such as the viewport for
example. In the context of CUDA based GPU computing this is the range of the
input domain to be processed by the particular GPU. It is left to the
developer to manage data distribution and kernel-specific launch parameters:

<ul>
<li>The correct offsets based on the compute range</li>
<li>The number of blocks (grid dimension)</li>
<li>The block parameters (block size)</li>
<li>The shared memory size</li>
</ul>

These parameters can be distributed using the common framedata mechanism.
Furthermore, we do not have to provide additional synchronisation
functionality because <i>__syncthreads()</i> only operates on GPU threads
within a particular block to coordinate shared memory access on the GPU.
</p>
<p><i>
Note that when the glinterop hint is specified, compute tasks can be
scheduled before and/or after the common rendering tasks.
</i></p>
<h3>Shared Memory</h3>
<p>
Data can either be replicated or partitioned on the participating nodes. In
case of (full or partial) data replication Equalizer provides a solution to
synchronise memory changes between participating nodes; i.e., to quickly
transfer memory changes from the (GPU-) memory of one node to the (GPU-)
memory of another node.
</p>
<p><i>
In case of partitioned global data message passing functionality is needed
to enable the communication between different nodes. This can be achieved
using a more generalised event system. This is not part of this extension,
though.
</i></p>
<p>
If data is replicated on multiple nodes, a subset of the data might
subsequently have to be synchronised at runtime. To guarantee an optimal
memory transfer performance a direct node-to-node communication model is
established through <b>shared memory proxy objects</b> which handle the
mapping and synchronisation of a specific memory range (see Figure 2).
The memory transfer from/to the GPU is performed implicitly by the proxy
objects as part of the map/sync/dirty/commit cycle.
</p>
<p>
<center>
<img src="images/memproxy.png"><BR><BR>
Figure 2: Data replication using proxy objects.
</center>
</p>
<p>
To simplify the initialisation of the proxy objects a global naming
directory is used which links custom proxy names to system defined
shared memory IDs. This directory is part of the shared data and thus can
be used by all nodes with only little overhead.
In case where the same memory range is modified by more than one node it is
up to the application to handle the synchronisation.
Please note that even though it is possible to map multiple proxies to the
same memory range it is not actually recommended.
</p>
<p><i>
The memory update process could be further optimised using a RMA based
network implementation.

<a name="Issues"></a>
<h2>Open Issues</h2>

<ol>
<li><b>CUDA Implementation:</b>
    Do we use the CUDA driver API or the CUDA runtime API for the
    implementation? These APIs are mutually exclusive.
    <BR><BR>
    For now we use the CUDA runtime API. It eases device code management by
    providing implicit initialization, context and module management. The
    host code generated by nvcc is based on the CUDA runtime API, so
    applications that link to this code must use the CUDA runtime API.
    Finally, device emulation only works for code written for the runtime
    API.
    <BR><BR>
</li>

<li><b>Equalizer Integration:</b>
    Do we have to introduce new abstractions as equivalent to Windows and
    Channels?
    <BR><BR>
    No. GPU compute tasks can be implemented on pipes (devices).
    <BR><BR>
</li>

<li><b>Generic Compositing:</b>
    Can we provide a generic compositing solution for arbitrary chunks of
    memory (think of software based rendering)?
    <BR><BR>
</li>

<li><b>Compound Definition:</b>
    How are generic devices/pipes integrated into the compound description?
    <BR><BR>
</li>

<li><b>Dynamic Workload Balancing:</b>
    Do we provide separate timing values to balance the compute tasks, or
    should they be integrated into the normal loadbalancing?
    <BR><BR>
</li>

<li><b>Kernel Launch Parameters:</b>
    Should the grid and block parameters be transported by Equalizer, or
    should this be done by the programmer using regular frame data? What if
    multiple kernels are used in one compute task, do they use the same
    launch configuration?
    <BR><BR>
</li>

<li><b>Memory Proxies:</b>
    Should we provide special-purpose implementations of shared memory
    proxy objects or just one abstract base class? E.g., a global array?
    <BR><BR>
</li>

<li><b>Asynchronous Memory Transfer:</b>
    How can we use asynchronous communication to hide the latency of the
    host-device transfer?
    <BR><BR>
</li>
