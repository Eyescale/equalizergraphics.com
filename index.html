<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  Equalizer is a programming interface and resource management system for
  scalable graphics applications. An Equalizer application can run unmodified on
  any visualization system, from a single-pipe workstation to large-scale
  distributed and shared memory visualization systems. Equalizer is
  build from ground up as a parallel, scalable programming interface solving the
  common problems for any multi-pipe application. Compared to other
  cluster-rendering software, it does not replace the OpenGL library but
  parallelizes and distributes the application's rendering code for optimal
  performance.
</p><p>
  The Equalizer frameworks consist of a server and a client
  library. Applications are written against the client library, which abstracts
  the interface to the execution environment. The applications are deployed by
  the server which balances the resource usage across the system. Traditional
  OpenGL applications can be executed transparently using an Equalizer-ready
  Chromium version, and thus take advantage of the system resource management
  without any additional configuration.

  In addition to traditional multi-pipe execution, where one graphics card is
  driving one display device, Equalizer offers a broad range of decomposition
  modes to accelerate the rendering of large data sets by parallelizing the
  rendering of a single view across multiple graphics cards and processors.

  Equalizer provides the natural execution framework for any multi-pipe
  application and does not impose any specific rendering framework, such
  as a scenegraph, to the application. It uses a callback-driven architecture,
  making it easy to port existing applications to Equalizer.

  Equalizer development started in 2005. As soon as it reaches an usable
  milestone, source code and binary distributions will be made available on
  this website. Equalizer is a cross-platform toolkit and will be initially
  available for Linux and Mac OS X. Feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact
  us</a> if you are interested to learn more about Equalizer, to participate in
  the design and development, or if you have any other questions.
