<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  Equalizer is a minimally invasive open source framework for the development of
  high-performance, scalable visualization software. An Equalizer application
  can run unmodified on any visualization system, from a single-pipe workstation
  to large-scale distributed and shared memory parallel visualization
  systems. 
</p><p>
  The Equalizer frameworks consist of a server and a client library. The
  Equalizer server automatically configures Equalizer applications to optimally
  use the provided visualization resources. Traditional OpenGL applications can
  be executed transparently using an Equalizer-ready Chromium version, and thus
  take advantage of the system resources without any additional configuration.

  In addition to traditional multi-pipe execution, where one graphics card is
  driving one display device, Equalizer offers a broad range of decomposition
  modes to accelerate the rendering of large data sets by parallelizing the
  rendering of a single view across multiple graphics cards.

  Equalizer provides the natural execution framework for any multi-pipe
  application and does not impose any specific rendering framework, such
  as a scenegraph, to the application. It uses a callback-driven architecture,
  making it easy to port existing applications to Equalizer.

  Equalizer development started in 2005. As soon as it reaches an usable
  milestone, source code and binary distributions will be made available on
  this website. Equalizer is a cross-platform toolkit and will be initially
  available for Linux, Mac OS X and SGI IRIX.
