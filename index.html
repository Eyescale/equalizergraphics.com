<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  Equalizer is a minimally invasive open source framework for the development of
  high-performance, scalable visualization software. An Equalizer application
  can run unmodified on any visualization system, from a single-pipe workstation
  to large-scale distributed and shared memory parallel visualization systems.
</p><p>
  Using a client-server model, the Equalizer server automatically configures
  Equalizer applications -the clients- to optimally use the provided
  visualization resources. Traditional OpenGL applications can be executed
  transparently using an Equalizer-ready Chromium version, and thus take
  advantage of the system resources without any additional configuration.

  In addition to traditional multi-pipe execution, where one graphics card is
  driving one display device, Equalizer offers a broad range of decomposition
  modes to accelerate the rendering of a single view by rendering in parallel on
  multiple graphics cards and combining the individual results.

  Equalizer provides the natural execution framework for any multi-pipe
  application and does not impose any specific rendering framework, such
  as a scenegraph, to the application. It uses a callback-driven architecture,
  making it easy to port existing applications to Equalizer.

  Equalizer development started in 2005. As soon as it reaches an usable
  milestone, the source code and binary distributions will be made available on
  this website.
