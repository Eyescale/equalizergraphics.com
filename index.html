<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Equalizer is a minimally invasive framework for the development of
high-performance, scalable visualization software. An Equalizer
application can run unmodified on any visualization system, from a
single-pipe workstation to large-scale distributed and shared memory
parallel visualization systems.
</p><p>
Using a client-server model, the Equalizer server automatically configures
Equalizer applications -the clients- to use the provided visualization
resources. Traditional OpenGL applications can be transparently executed using
an Equalizer-ready Chromium version, and thus take advantage of the system's
resources without any additional configuration.

</p><p>
In addition to traditional multi-pipe execution, where one graphics card is
connected to one display device, Equalizer offers a broad range of decomposition
modes to accelerate the rendering of a single view by combining the results of
multipe graphics cards. <a href="">More about scalability...</a>
</p><p>
Equalizer provides the natural execution framework for any multi-pipe
application and does not impose any specific rendering framework, such
as a scenegraph, to the application. It uses a callback-driven architecture,
making it easy to port existing applications to Equalizer. <a href="">More about
the API...</a>
